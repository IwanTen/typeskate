Typeskate is an applicatiion built with the purpose to merge the flow state captured by skateboarding with the technicality and flow of typing on a keyboard.

This project is built using the Phaser javascript game engine, Typescript, and React.

1. ANIMATIONS.

As per Phaser guidelines, animations are exported globally in the animations directory.

//TODO: Create animation object defining the individual frames that pertain to each animation.

Make sure that these frames define the size of each frame, as well as the playback speed.

- Must figure out how to control each animation depending on input on order to create a system that animated the skater based on proximity with objects, the ground etc.

For the time being I will be working with the Arcade physics system. Will explore Matter if needed.
